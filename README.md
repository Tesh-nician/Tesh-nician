# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tesh-nician 

In Sep 2024  I finished my one-year intensive Java EE course at Intec Brussels (phew!). \
In a nutshell, we covered:
<UL>
<LI>Advanced Java (Collections, streams and lambdas, multi-threading (aarghh), ...)</LI>
<LI>J-Unit for testing (via Maven)</LI>
<LI>SQL, MYSQL, Hibernate</LI>
<LI>Basic frontend skills: HTML, CSS, some Typescript, basic Angular</LI>
<LI>Introduction to agile methodology (using Trello)</LI>
<LI>Spring Framework for Java (wow!)</LI>

</UL>

In my last month of the course I also used Mokito for my final project. My conclusion is that it is probably great for for complex methods but sucks for CRUD glue code. UPDATE: in retrospect, I now suspect that the real problem was IntelliJ's intellisense proposing non-existent methods.  

My plans for the near future:
<UL>
<LI> Completing the intensive 4-month webdev course at CFI Tech Koekelberg  (Sep-Dec 2025) https://cfitech.be/formation_longue/developpeur/
 <BR> Yes, I love the (multi-cultural) on-site format. Nothing beats a real teacher who pushes you to your limits.  :-) 
 
<LI> <S>switching to Eclipse from IntelliJ, seeing as I am no longer a student who gets IntelliJ Ultimate for free</S>
  <BR>PhpStorm is now my new IntelliJ :-)
<LI> <S>then either learn Python or delve into AI for Java?</S> Javascript and PHP for the coming 6 months. 
<LI> contribute to an open source project, if I can find one that can use a beginning Dev.
 <LI> get a new hip. Jan 2026?
 
</UL>

Hoping to volunteer for FOSDEM again this year, so hopefully we will bump into each other :-)
