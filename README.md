# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tesh-nician 

I recently finished my one-year intensive Java EE course at Intec Brussels (phew!). \
In a nutshell, we covered:
<UL>
<LI>Advanced Java (Collections, streams and lambas, multi-threading (aarghh), ...)</LI>
<LI>J-Unit for testing (via Maven)</LI>
<LI>SQL, MYSQL, Hibernate</LI>
<LI>Basic frontend skills: HTML, CSS, some Typescript, basic Angular</LI>
<LI>Introduction to agile methodology (using Trello)</LI>
<LI>Spring Framework for Java (wow!)</LI>

</UL>

In my last month of the course I also used Mokito for my final project. My conclusion is that it is probably great for for complex methods but sucks for CRUD glue code.

My plans for the near future:
<UL>
<LI> getting to grips with Javascript,
<LI> switching to Eclipse from IntelliJ, seeing as I am no longer a student who gets IntelliJ Ultimate for free :-(
<LI> then either learn Python or delve into AI for Java?
<LI> contribute to an open source project, if I can find one that can use a beginning Dev. 
 
</UL>

Hoping to volunteer for FOSDEM this year, so hopefully we will bump into each other :-)
